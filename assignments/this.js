/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Binding: when "this" tries to bind to window (bad!)
* 2. Implicit Binding: when a function is called & the object on the left side of the dot get "this"; specifically for objects
* 3. Explicit binding: used to control within functions; when call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined
* 4. New Binding: applies "this" binding to conrtuctor function; refers to object that is created & returned by constructor function 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
